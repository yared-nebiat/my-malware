# my-malware

This Python script establishes a Telegram bot that offers various functionalities including WiFi credential retrieval, system control commands, and web browsing capabilities.

## Features

- **WiFi Credential Retrieval**: The bot can extract and send stored WiFi SSIDs and passwords on the host machine.
- **System Commands**: Includes commands for logging out of the system.
- **Web Search**: Ability to open a web search in an incognito Chrome window.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `telebot` Python module
- A Telegram bot token (obtained from BotFather on Telegram)

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed along with the `telebot` module.
2. **Bot Token and Telegram ID**: Replace `TELGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `YOUR_TELEGRAM_ID` in the script with your actual Telegram bot token and Telegram user ID, respectively.
3. **Execution**: Run the script on the target computer (optionally as a trojan horse by compiling it into an executable). It will send a "connection found" message to the hacker and start listening for commands through Telegram.

## Usage

- **Grab WiFi Credentials**: Send the `/grab_wifi` command to the bot. It will respond with a file containing stored WiFi SSIDs and passwords.
- **Shutdown or Logout**: Use the `/logout` command to logout of the system.
- **Web Search**: Send a message starting with `goto ` followed by the website you want to open.
